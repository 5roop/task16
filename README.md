# Task 16 

Exploratory analysis of Serbian and Bosnian parliamentary data.

## 2022-10-27T15:34:45

First grievances: I started with Serbian data. The Sessions are named highly inconsistently (S-, Sv6...)

## 2022-10-28T07:56:51

Managed to generate session-level texts and metadata. Proceeding with session-level components.

## 2022-10-28T14:09:42

Created session level components for Serbian.

Serbian MPs do not always have full birth dates, sometimes only year is listed under date_of_birth! 

I impute the missing values in the parties and MP tables.
